TS:

- helps us catch errors during development
- uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
- only active during development
- does not provide any performance optimazation

tsc - TypeScript compiler

Running VSC by
code .

Combining tsc and node commands:
ts-node


Cannot execute ts code in plain node or browser environment

<variable > as <Interface> <- requires to meet Interface conditions - if not, it is marked in the code editor

Type annotations -> what type of var will refer to

Type inference - > TypeScript guesses a types

Type anno when?

- function returns 'any' type and we nned to clarify the value
- we need to declare a variable on one line then init it later
- when we want a variable to have a type that cannot be inferred


AVOID any at all costs!!!
