// Single container for Redis
// Separated Docker Containers with Node App and Redis

// To join to containers we can use Docker CLI Network or Docker Compose
// Docker Compose is solution used frequently in industrial environment

// Docker Compose
// Separate CLI that gets installed along with Docker
// Used to start up multiple Docker containers at the same time
// Automates some of the long-winded arguments we were passing to 'docker run'

version: '3'
services:
  redis-server:
    image: 'redis'
  node-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "4001:8081"

// First port - out of container: 4001. Second, inside container: 8081
// Ports props is used to make app visible on local machine 
// When 'redis-server' connection is going out from Express app, Docker sees it, and point to docker image

// Docker automatically looks at active directory for docker-compose.yaml file
// docker-compose up = docker run myimage
// docker-compose up --build = docker build . && docker run myimage

// Launch in background: docker-compose up -d
// Stop containers: docker-compose down
