// How to makes requests from k8s?

// Service!

// Types of Services

// Cluster IP - set URL to access a pod
// Node Port - makes a pod accessible from outside the Cluster (dev purposes)
// Load balancer - make a pod accessible from outside the Cluster (right prod expose way )
// External name - redirects an in-cluster request to a CNAME url... (not imporant for basics)

// Configuring Node Port!
// Selector selects what pod has to be exposed!

// Port vs targetPort

// targetPort - specific for node application
// port - node service port

// k get services
// PORTS props shows under which port service is available 
// Can access to posts service by: <minikube-ip>:<node-service-port>

// How communicate two pods?
// Using Cluster IP Service
// Technically two pods has own ips, but Cluster IP provides easy-to-undestrand way to communicate

// Need to give different services names to not overwrite!

// When services are set up, just need to wire it all up!

// Our microservices, thanks to Cluster IP Services, can communicate one another using: <service-name>:<port>
// Need to change 'localhost' to <service-name> in code

// Apply many yaml files
// kubectl apply -f . <- find all config files inside location
