CI/CD 

How to manage a project?

CI - classic one
CD - deploy code from GitHub to K8s cluster

Using MonoRepo

To add past submodule "common" folder:

-> git rm --cached ticketing-app\common 

GitHub Actions

build -> uses: actions/checkout@v2 
<- uses all code of the project

npm run test:ci <- it is required to close the session after tests are done!
test:ci = jest <- jest by default does it
