Orders service

- userId
- status
- expiresAt
- ticketId


Creating an order to purchase the specific ticket

--

Adding version flag in ticket to track how many times the ticket was updated

---

Validation including Mongo ID recognition? Too specific?
depends

can do it as below:

custom((input: string) => {
    mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(input)
})

--- 

lookup and population!

Option 1 - Embedding -> challenging to query, mixing responsibility
Option 2 - Population

Hadling population types with TS?


---

setting enum on mongoose schema property to limit possible values

---

Can query using mongoose by whole object as query param 
-> ticket: ticket. Usually done it by targeting id (??)

---

!!existingOrder -> Boolean(existingOrder)

---

There is not possibility to test handler manually, because orders service cannot create tickets!
We can test it in cluster, or create some records manually in a db :/

---

it.todo <- marking test "to-do"

---

As Stephen said DELETE keyword is not the best choice here, because we only
change status here (PATCH fits the best)
DELETE returns 204 status - No Content

Order Service flow

orders:created
- Tickets service needs to be told that one of its tickets has been reserved - need to lock it
- Payments service need to know there is a new order that a user mignt submit for Payments
- Expiration service needs to start a 15 minute timer to eventually time out this order

Tickets Service has tickets
Orders Service has orders and tickets
Payments has charges and orders

orders:cancelled
- Unreserving the ticket
- Reject payments


--- 
Can pass min or max of values in event - depends on strategy
