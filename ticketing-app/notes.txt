Sharing code options

Option 1 - Direct Copy Paste - poor solution
Option 2 - Git submodule (sic!) - cool but bit challenging
Option 3 - NPM Package (sic!!) - pain in maintenece but the best

NPM Organizations

Security -> NPM public registry or NPM private registry 

There might be differences ni our TS settings between the common library
and our services - don't want to deal with that

Services might not be written with TS at all

Our common library will be written as TS and published as JS

-- 

tsconfig.json

Uncommenting "declaration", "outDir"

Want to make sure that importing js file from our library

Updating version of library:

- npm version patch

Little script to this tut usage! (pub)

To update npm!!

- npm update [library]

To verify inside the pod:
- kubectl get pods
- kubectl exec -it <pod_name> sh <- deprecated now!

Hacking - I don't know what is going on in "common" module
-> Make console.log inside node_modules :O

Mongoose

doc.set({

})

- can update a document

await doc.save() - guarantee reference to updated "doc"
