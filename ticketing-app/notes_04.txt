-> payment:created publisher

Version is really important when we have possibility to update a record!

Stripe JS library as payment dialog (frontend)
Stripe JS library as payment service API

Request create a "charge" ->

{
    token: 'dsadas',
    orderId: 'ABC'

}

Find order the user is trying to pay for
Make sure the order belongs to this user
Make sure the payment amount matches the amount due for the order
Verify payment with Stripe API
Create "charge" record to record successful payment

Using Node Stripe SDK
stripe.com

We're going to use always working token "tok_visa"
We're working in a test mode, we don't want to be involved in a real money, credit cards etc. :O

Testing by mock approach and realistic approach (less abstract)

Lot of options -> retrieve a charge, list all charges

Jest .toBeDefined() work specifically with "undefined" status
If null .toBeDefined() passes
Need to use not.toBeNull()
